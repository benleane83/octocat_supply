## Required Workflows

The applied ruleset [OD OctoCAT Supply Ruleset]() (see [governance.md](./governance.md) for more information) enforces a required workflow [Dependency Review](/blob/main/.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml).

You can showcase how this works in the PR with the Title `Feature: Add ToS Download`.

The required workflow lives in the repository  under - [.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml](/blob/main/.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml)

You can demo how required workflows can be used to enforce generalized required checks like a dependency review. Highlight how the workflow can live in any other repository or even within another organizaiton of the same enterprise.
